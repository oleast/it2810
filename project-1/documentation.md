## IT2810: Web Development - Project 1 documentation

This project aims to showcase how beatiful our planet can be.

### JavaScript
It does so by fetching pictures from reddit's 'r/earthporn' section in the json format and displaying them dynamically as i gets them. This is done with the built in JavaScript fetch method for making HTTP requests.
JavaScript is also used to make the website anchors scroll smoothly to website anchors instead of jumping to them.

### CSS
Displaying the images is done with css flexbox to make sure they are displayed well on multiple screen sizes.
