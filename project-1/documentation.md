## IT2810: Web Development - Project 1 documentation

### 1. and 2. CSS
Displaying the images is done with css flexbox to make sure they are displayed well on multiple screen sizes.
Dynamically loaded images and a few other elements use box shadow to make them stand out of the flat design.
Smooth scrolling to anchors is implemented via CSS, but works only in supported browsers.
Navbar has been made with CSS grid.
Sizing is primarily done with rem units to better suit more screen sizes.

### 3. JavaScript
This project aims to showcase how beatiful our planet can be.
It does so by fetching pictures from reddit's 'r/earthporn' section in the json format and displaying them dynamically as i gets them with the built in createElement() and appendChild() methods. HTTP requests are made with the built in JavaScript fetch() function.

### 4. Favicon
The favicon is loaded in via a standard html <link rel="icon">

### 5. Validated HTML
HTML has been validated at: https://validator.w3.org/

### 6. Separate Files
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all in their own files.
